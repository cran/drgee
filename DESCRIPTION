Description: Fit restricted mean models for the conditional association between an exposure and an outcome, given covariates. Three methods are implemented: O-estimation, where a nuisance model for the association between the covariates and the outcome is used; E-estimation where a nuisance model for the association between the covariates and the exposure is used, and doubly robust (DR) estimation where both nuisance models are used. In DR-estimation, the estimates will be consistent when at least one of the nuisance models is correctly specified, not necessarily both. For more information, see Zetterqvist and Sjölander (2015) <doi:10.1515/em-2014-0021>.
