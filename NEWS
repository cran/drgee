Changes in version 1.1.1 (2015-04-20)

o The arguments 'outcome', 'exposure' and 'clusterid'
  can be supplied as vectors or as a string.

o Changed the interface for the 'drgee' function.
  Now the argument 'estimationMethod' has to be
  "dr","o", or "e" corresponding to previous choices 
  "dr", "obe" and "ebe".
  When 'estimationMethod="o"', the user can supply an
  argument 'exposure' instead of 'emodel'. Similarly,
  when 'estimationMethod="e"', the user can supply an
  argument 'outcome' instead of 'omodel'.

o Changed the functions 'drgee' and 'gee' such
  that they always return the variance as a matrix.

Changes in version 1.1.0 (2015-02-09)

o Added a function 'gee' which calculates all
  coefficients in a regression.

o Added an option 'cond' for 'drgee' and 'gee' for
  models with cluster-specific intercepts.

Changes in version 1.0.1 (2014-01-27)

o Fixed a bug in 'drFit'. The calculation of the
  Jacobian was incorrect for doubly robust estimation
  with outcome link logit, resulting in inconsistent
  estimates of standard errors. This bug is now fixed.


Changes in Version 1.0 (2013-12-19)

o First version released on CRAN
